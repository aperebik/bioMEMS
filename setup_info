We will use the conda command to create a standard python environment for this course. 

Create a new environment by entering (or pasting) the following commands at a shell prompt (for example the Anaconda command prompt):

conda create -n BioMEMS python=3.6 pip ipython jupyter numpy scipy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn hdf5 pytables
Activate the new environment using (this should add "(BioMEMS)" to your command prompt, as a reminder of your current environment):

conda activate MLS
Add some additional packages from other sources (details here and here):

conda install -c conda-forge libiconv jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
conda install -c astropy lmfit emcee
